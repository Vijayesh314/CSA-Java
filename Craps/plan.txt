How to play Craps
- You roll two dice
- If you roll a 7 or 11, you win
- If you roll a 2, 3, or 12, you lose
- If neither of those conditions match, whoever has the highest number roll wins

What code is needed
- ASCII dice for numbers 1-6
- Random numbers
- Conditionals to compare totals and check for auto win/lose mechanics
- Comparison between user and computer

When does a player win
- Win if the first roll is a 7 or 11, Lose if is a 2, 3, or 12
- Otherwise, highest number roll wins

How to apply DeMorgan's Law
- Check if the roll is not any of the special cases
